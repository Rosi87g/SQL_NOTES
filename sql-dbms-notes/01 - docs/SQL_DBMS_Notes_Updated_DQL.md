# SQL & DATABASE FUNDAMENTALS — Updated DQL Notes

> Updated with **DQL — Retrieving and Filtering Data**, expanded interview questions for Chapters 1–9, and DQL interview preparation.

## Chapter 10 — DQL: Retrieving and Filtering Data

# Chapter 10 — DQL: Retrieving and Filtering Data

Chapter 3 introduced DQL as the category used to retrieve information. This chapter goes deeper into SELECT and the filtering techniques used in real applications and interview problems.

> **Core idea:** SELECT decides which columns appear in the result. WHERE decides which rows are allowed into the result. You can use them independently or together.

## 10.1 Selecting All Columns and Specific Columns

The SELECT statement retrieves data from a table. Use * when every column is required; use specific column names when an application, report, or screen needs only selected information.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students;
```

The asterisk (*) means all columns from the table written after FROM.

```sql
SELECT student_name
FROM students;
```

Only student_name is displayed. The other columns still exist in the table; they are simply not included in this result.

### Selecting Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT student_name, score
FROM students;
```

Separate multiple column names with commas. Do not add a comma after the final column.

> **Column order matters:** The result columns appear in the same order in which they are written in SELECT.

```sql
SELECT score, student_name
FROM students;
```

This displays score first and student_name second. It does not change the table structure.

### Columns and Rows Are Different

Selecting two columns does not mean selecting two rows. SELECT controls the columns displayed; without WHERE, all rows are returned.

```sql
SELECT student_name, score
FROM students;
```

> **When should you use SELECT *?** It is useful for exploring a small table or viewing the complete table. For application screens and reports, selecting only required columns is usually clearer and avoids retrieving unnecessary data.

## 10.2 Creating Column Aliases Using AS

A column alias is a temporary name given to a column in the query result. It changes the heading displayed by the query, not the column name stored in the original table.

```sql
SELECT employee_name AS name
FROM employees;
```

The original column remains employee_name. Only the result heading becomes name.

### Aliases for Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT
    employee_name AS name,
    monthly_salary AS salary
FROM employees;
```

Each selected expression can have its own alias.

### Aliases Containing Spaces

In MySQL, if an alias contains spaces, enclose it in backticks.

```sql
SELECT
    employee_name AS `Employee Name`,
    monthly_salary AS `Monthly Salary`
FROM employees;
```

> **AS is optional in MySQL:** A query such as SELECT employee_name name FROM employees; works, but using AS makes the intent clearer and is preferred for readable learning and reporting queries.

### Why Are Aliases Useful?

- Create readable report headings.
- Give meaningful names to calculated columns.
- Simplify long or technical column names in query results.
- Make application and reporting output easier to understand.

## 10.3 Creating Calculated Columns in Query Results

A calculated column is a value produced by an expression inside SELECT. It does not have to exist as a stored column in the table.

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    quantity,
    price * quantity AS total_value
FROM products;
```

The expression price * quantity is evaluated separately for every row. The calculation appears only in the query result; it does not modify the stored data.

### Common Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Operation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | salary + bonus |
| - | Subtraction | price - discount |
| * | Multiplication | price * quantity |
| / | Division | total_marks / subjects |
| % | Remainder | number % 2 |

### Adding Values

```sql
SELECT
    employee_name,
    salary,
    bonus,
    salary + bonus AS total_pay
FROM employees;
```

### Subtracting a Discount

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    discount,
    price - discount AS final_price
FROM products;
```

### Calculating a Percentage

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    price * 18 / 100 AS tax_amount,
    price + (price * 18 / 100) AS final_amount
FROM products;
```

> **Parentheses:** Use parentheses to make a calculation explicit and easier to read, especially when an expression contains several operators.

### Multiple Calculated Columns

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    price * 10 / 100 AS discount_amount,
    price - (price * 10 / 100) AS final_price
FROM products;
```

### Order of Arithmetic Calculation

1. Parentheses
2. Multiplication and division
3. Addition and subtraction

```sql
SELECT
    price + price * 18 / 100 AS final_amount
FROM products;

SELECT
    price * (1 + 18 / 100) AS final_amount
FROM products;
```

Both expressions are intended to calculate the same 18% increase, while the parenthesized version makes the intended grouping especially clear.

> **Important:** A calculated column in SELECT is not the same as UPDATE. SELECT calculates a value for the result only; UPDATE changes stored data.

## 10.4 Filtering Records Using WHERE

The WHERE clause filters rows based on a condition. Only rows for which the condition is true are returned.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE';
```

The condition is checked for each row, and only CSE students appear in the result.

### WHERE Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Filtering Text

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE placement_status = 'Placed';
```

Text values must be enclosed in quotes.

### Filtering Numeric Values

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE student_id = 103;
```

Numeric values do not require quotes.

### Selecting Columns and Filtering Rows Together

```sql
SELECT student_name, score
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE';
```

SELECT controls which columns appear; WHERE controls which rows appear.

### Correct Clause Order

```sql
SELECT student_name, placement_status
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'ECE';
```

> **Clause order matters:** The normal form is SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE .... Writing WHERE before FROM is incorrect SQL syntax.

## 10.5 Comparison Operators with Numbers, Text and Dates

Comparison operators compare a value with another value. A comparison produces a logical result: true when the condition matches and false when it does not.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | Equal to | score = 75 |
| <> | Not equal to | status <> 'Rejected' |
| > | Greater than | score > 75 |
| < | Less than | score < 75 |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | score >= 75 |
| <= | Less than or equal to | score <= 75 |

### Comparing Numbers

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, score
FROM job_applications
WHERE score > 80;
```

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, score
FROM job_applications
WHERE score < 75;
```

### Understanding Boundary Values

| Requirement | Correct condition |
| --- | --- |
| Score is exactly 75 | score = 75 |
| Score is not 75 | score <> 75 |
| Score is above 75 | score > 75 |
| Score is at least 75 | score >= 75 |
| Score is below 75 | score < 75 |
| Score is at most 75 | score <= 75 |

> **Boundary words:** 'At least' and 'greater than or equal to' mean >=. 'At most' and 'less than or equal to' mean <=. 'Above'/'greater than' exclude the boundary; 'below'/'less than' exclude it.

### Comparing Text

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, status
FROM job_applications
WHERE status = 'Shortlisted';

SELECT candidate_name, status
FROM job_applications
WHERE status <> 'Rejected';
```

Text comparisons depend on the stored value. For example, 'Under Review' is not the same stored text as 'UnderReview'.

### Comparing Dates

Write dates using the YYYY-MM-DD format so MySQL can compare them chronologically.

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, applied_date
FROM job_applications
WHERE applied_date > '2026-08-15';
```

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, applied_date
FROM job_applications
WHERE applied_date >= '2026-08-15';
```

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, applied_date
FROM job_applications
WHERE applied_date < '2026-08-18';
```

The difference between > and >= is whether the boundary date itself is excluded or included.

## 10.6 Combining Conditions Using AND, OR and NOT

Real application requirements often contain more than one condition. SQL provides AND, OR, and NOT to combine or reverse conditions.

| Operator | Meaning | Mental model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AND | Every connected condition must be true | All requirements must match |
| OR | At least one connected condition must be true | Any acceptable option can match |
| NOT | The condition is reversed | The condition must be false |

### Using AND

Use AND when every condition must be satisfied.

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch, score
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
AND score >= 80;
```

A row must satisfy both conditions: it must be CSE and have a score of at least 80.

### Using More Than Two AND Conditions

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch, score, placement_status
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
AND score >= 80
AND placement_status = 'Placed';
```

The row must satisfy all three conditions.

### Using OR

Use OR when satisfying any one condition is enough.

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
OR branch = 'ISE';
```

This returns students from either branch. If one row satisfies both OR conditions, it still appears only once.

### Using NOT

```sql
SELECT student_name, placement_status
FROM students
WHERE NOT placement_status = 'Placed';
```

This reverses the condition and returns rows whose placement_status is not 'Placed'. The same requirement can commonly be written as:

```sql
SELECT student_name, placement_status
FROM students
WHERE placement_status <> 'Placed';
```

> **Requirement words:** 'and' usually indicates AND; 'either/or' usually indicates OR; 'not', 'except', or 'excluding' usually indicates NOT. Always translate the exact business requirement before writing the SQL.

## 10.7 Controlling Condition Priority Using Parentheses

When AND and OR are mixed, SQL does not simply evaluate conditions from left to right. Parentheses explicitly group conditions and make the intended logic clear.

The relevant logical priority is:

1. Parentheses
2. NOT
3. AND
4. OR

### Why Parentheses Matter

Suppose a training team wants students who belong to CSE or ISE and who have a score of at least 80.

```sql
-- Intended: (CSE or ISE) AND score >= 80
SELECT student_name, branch, score
FROM students
WHERE (branch = 'CSE' OR branch = 'ISE')
AND score >= 80;
```

Without the parentheses, the query can be interpreted according to operator precedence rather than the business grouping you intended.

```sql
-- Easy to misread:
SELECT student_name, branch, score
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
OR branch = 'ISE'
AND score >= 80;
```

Because AND has higher priority than OR, the second query is treated like:

```sql
branch = 'CSE'
OR (branch = 'ISE' AND score >= 80)
```

> **Best practice:** Whenever AND and OR are mixed, use parentheses to show the intended groups—even when the default precedence would happen to produce the desired result.

### Changing the Group Changes the Meaning

```sql
-- Group A: Development OR Testing, then salary requirement
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE (department = 'Development' OR department = 'Testing')
AND salary >= 50000;
```

```sql
-- Group B: every Development employee OR qualifying Testing employee
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Development'
OR (department = 'Testing' AND salary >= 50000);
```

The conditions look similar, but the grouping produces different result sets.

### Parentheses with AND and OR Requirements

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
AND (placement_status = 'Placed' OR score >= 90);
```

The student must be in CSE, and then at least one condition inside the parentheses must be true.

## 10.8 Filtering from a List Using IN and NOT IN

IN checks whether a value matches any value in a specified list. It is a cleaner alternative to writing many OR conditions for the same column.

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch
FROM students
WHERE branch IN ('CSE', 'ISE', 'ECE');
```

This is conceptually similar to:

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
OR branch = 'ISE'
OR branch = 'ECE';
```

### NOT IN

```sql
SELECT student_name, branch
FROM students
WHERE branch NOT IN ('CSE', 'ISE');
```

This returns rows whose branch is not one of the listed values.

> **NULL caveat with NOT IN:** If the tested column can contain NULL, NOT IN can produce surprising results because comparisons with NULL are not TRUE or FALSE in the ordinary sense. Use IS NULL/IS NOT NULL when you specifically need to handle missing values.

## 10.9 Filtering Ranges Using BETWEEN

BETWEEN checks whether a value lies within an inclusive range. The boundary values are included.

```sql
SELECT student_name, score
FROM students
WHERE score BETWEEN 70 AND 80;
```

This includes scores of 70 and 80.

### BETWEEN with Dates

```sql
SELECT candidate_name, applied_date
FROM job_applications
WHERE applied_date BETWEEN '2026-08-10' AND '2026-08-20';
```

For a DATE column, the start and end dates are included.

### NOT BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT student_name, score
FROM students
WHERE score NOT BETWEEN 70 AND 80;
```

This returns values outside the inclusive range.

> **Interview point:** BETWEEN is inclusive. If the requirement says 'strictly greater than 70 and strictly less than 80', use score > 70 AND score < 80 instead.

## 10.10 Searching Patterns Using LIKE and Wildcards

LIKE performs pattern matching on text values. It is useful when the exact complete text is not known or when you want to search for a name, email, city, or other text pattern.

### LIKE Wildcards

| Wildcard | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| % | Matches zero or more characters | 'A%' matches A, Asha, Aarav |
| _ | Matches exactly one character | '_a%' matches any string with a character before a |

### Starts With

```sql
SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'A%';
```

Matches names beginning with A.

### Ends With

```sql
SELECT customer_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

Matches email values ending with @gmail.com.

### Contains

```sql
SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%an%';
```

Matches names containing the sequence 'an'.

### Exactly One Character at a Position

```sql
SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE '_a%';
```

The underscore represents exactly one character before a.

> **LIKE vs =:** Use = when you want an exact comparison. Use LIKE when you want pattern matching with wildcards.

## 10.11 Checking Missing Values Using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

NULL represents a missing, unknown, or not-applicable value. NULL is not the same as 0, an empty string, or the text 'NULL'.

### Checking for NULL

```sql
SELECT customer_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

This returns customers whose email value is NULL.

### Checking for Non-NULL Values

```sql
SELECT customer_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```

This returns rows where email has a non-NULL value.

### Why = NULL Does Not Work

```sql
-- Incorrect for checking NULL
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email = NULL;

-- Correct
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

> **Remember:** Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL for NULL checks. Do not use = NULL or <> NULL.

## 10.12 Putting the Filtering Operators Together

The real power of DQL comes from combining selection, calculated columns, aliases, and filtering in one query.

```sql
SELECT
    product_name AS `Product Name`,
    price AS `Unit Price`,
    quantity,
    price * quantity AS `Total Value`
FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 500 AND 5000
AND quantity >= 2;
```

This query demonstrates four ideas at once: selected columns, aliases, a calculated column, and a WHERE clause containing multiple conditions.

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    email
FROM customers
WHERE (city IN ('Bengaluru', 'Hyderabad')
       OR email LIKE '%@gmail.com')
AND email IS NOT NULL;
```

Parentheses make the OR group explicit, IN handles a list, LIKE performs a pattern search, and IS NOT NULL removes missing emails from the final result.

## 10.13 Common DQL Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it is wrong | Correct idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SELECT * when only two columns are needed | Retrieves unnecessary columns and makes application output less precise | Select only the required columns |
| WHERE before FROM | Incorrect SQL clause order | SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... |
| Forgetting quotes around text | Text values must be represented as string literals | WHERE branch = 'CSE' |
| Using = NULL | NULL requires special handling | Use IS NULL |
| Using > when requirement says at least | Excludes the boundary | Use >= for 'at least' |
| Mixing AND and OR without grouping | Can produce unintended logic | Use parentheses |
| Using LIKE for an exact match unnecessarily | Pattern matching is less direct | Use = for exact equality |
| Forgetting that BETWEEN is inclusive | Boundary values are included | Use >/< if boundaries must be excluded |

## 10.14 SELECT vs WHERE — Interview Mental Model

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What does SELECT control? | Which columns/expressions appear in the result. |
| What does WHERE control? | Which rows satisfy the filter and appear in the result. |
| Does WHERE change the table? | No. A SELECT ... WHERE query only reads and returns matching rows. |
| Does a calculated column change stored data? | No. It exists only in that query result. |
| Does an alias rename the original column? | No. It changes the result heading only. |

## Chapter 10 — Final Takeaway

DQL is about asking precise questions of stored data. SELECT chooses what you want to see, WHERE chooses which rows qualify, aliases make output readable, calculated columns create values at query time, comparison operators express boundaries, AND/OR/NOT combine logic, parentheses control grouping, IN handles lists, BETWEEN handles inclusive ranges, LIKE handles text patterns, and IS NULL/IS NOT NULL handle missing values.

> **Golden rule for interviews:** Translate the requirement into row conditions first, decide which columns must be displayed second, then write SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... and add parentheses whenever AND and OR are mixed.

## Interview Questions — DQL

### Q1. What is the difference between SELECT and WHERE?
**Ideal answer:** SELECT chooses the columns or expressions displayed in the result; WHERE filters the rows that are allowed into the result.

### Q2. Does SELECT ... WHERE modify the table?
**Ideal answer:** No. It only reads and returns matching data.

### Q3. What does SELECT * mean?
**Ideal answer:** It selects all columns from the table specified in FROM.

### Q4. How do you select multiple columns?
**Ideal answer:** Write the column names after SELECT and separate them with commas.

### Q5. Does the order of columns in SELECT matter?
**Ideal answer:** Yes. It determines the order of columns in the query result.

### Q6. What is a column alias?
**Ideal answer:** A temporary result heading assigned to a selected column or expression, commonly using AS.

### Q7. Does an alias rename the original table column?
**Ideal answer:** No. It changes only the name displayed in that query result.

### Q8. Can an alias contain spaces in MySQL?
**Ideal answer:** Yes. Enclose the alias in backticks, for example AS `Monthly Salary`.

### Q9. What is a calculated column?
**Ideal answer:** A result column produced by evaluating an expression such as price * quantity inside SELECT.

### Q10. Does a calculated column permanently store its result?
**Ideal answer:** No. Unless separately persisted through another operation, the calculation exists only in the query result.

### Q11. What is WHERE used for?
**Ideal answer:** To filter rows according to a condition.

### Q12. What is the difference between > and >=?
**Ideal answer:** > excludes the boundary; >= includes it.

### Q13. What does BETWEEN do?
**Ideal answer:** It checks whether a value falls within an inclusive range.

### Q14. Is BETWEEN inclusive?
**Ideal answer:** Yes. Both the lower and upper boundary values are included.

### Q15. What is the difference between IN and OR?
**Ideal answer:** IN checks one expression against a list of values and is a concise alternative to multiple equality comparisons joined by OR.

### Q16. What is the difference between = and LIKE?
**Ideal answer:** = performs an equality comparison; LIKE performs pattern matching and supports wildcards.

### Q17. What does % mean in LIKE?
**Ideal answer:** It matches zero or more characters.

### Q18. What does _ mean in LIKE?
**Ideal answer:** It matches exactly one character.

### Q19. Why can't you use = NULL to find missing values?
**Ideal answer:** NULL represents an unknown/missing value, so ordinary equality does not test for it. Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.

### Q20. What is the difference between IS NULL and IS NOT NULL?
**Ideal answer:** IS NULL finds rows whose value is NULL; IS NOT NULL finds rows whose value is not NULL.

### Q21. What does AND mean in a WHERE clause?
**Ideal answer:** Every connected condition must be true.

### Q22. What does OR mean?
**Ideal answer:** At least one connected condition must be true.

### Q23. What does NOT do?
**Ideal answer:** It reverses a condition.

### Q24. What is the logical priority of parentheses, NOT, AND and OR?
**Ideal answer:** Parentheses have the highest grouping priority, followed by NOT, then AND, then OR.

### Q25. Why are parentheses important when mixing AND and OR?
**Ideal answer:** They explicitly define which conditions belong together and prevent the query from being interpreted differently from the business requirement.

### Q26. What is a common mistake with NOT IN and NULL?
**Ideal answer:** If the tested column contains NULL, NOT IN can behave unexpectedly. Handle NULL explicitly when it is possible.

### Q27. Can WHERE be used with UPDATE and DELETE?
**Ideal answer:** Yes. WHERE can restrict which rows an UPDATE or DELETE affects, and it is critical for avoiding accidental changes to every row.

### Q28. Can you use a SELECT alias in WHERE?
**Ideal answer:** In a normal query block, a SELECT-list alias generally cannot be referenced in WHERE because WHERE is evaluated before the SELECT list. Repeat the expression or use a subquery/CTE when appropriate.

### Q29. What is the conceptual logical processing order of a simple SELECT query?
**Ideal answer:** FROM identifies the source rows, WHERE filters them, and SELECT produces the requested output expressions. This helps explain why SELECT aliases are generally unavailable in WHERE.

### Q30. Why is selecting specific columns preferred in application queries?
**Ideal answer:** It makes the result clearer, avoids unnecessary data retrieval, and gives the application exactly the fields it needs.

## Additional Interview Questions — Chapters 1–9

### Chapter 1 — Data

**Q1. What is data?**
**Ideal answer:** Data is a collection of raw facts, figures, and details such as numbers, text, or dates. It becomes information when organized and given context.

**Q2. Why is data important to modern applications?**
**Ideal answer:** Applications use data to operate, personalize experiences, make decisions, and maintain records. Storing it reliably is a core requirement of software systems.

**Q3. Structured vs semi-structured data?**
**Ideal answer:** Structured data follows a fixed row-and-column structure. Semi-structured data has labels or tags but does not require a rigid table, such as JSON or XML.

**Q4. Is JSON structured data?**
**Ideal answer:** In the classification used in these notes, JSON is semi-structured because it contains labeled fields without requiring a rigid relational table.

**Q5. Give a data-to-information example.**
**Ideal answer:** The value 25 is data; 'Rahul is 25 years old' adds context and meaning, making it information.

### Chapter 2 — DBMS, RDBMS and SQL

**Q1. Is every DBMS an RDBMS?**
**Ideal answer:** No. RDBMS is a type of DBMS based on the relational model.

**Q2. Is MySQL the same as SQL?**
**Ideal answer:** No. SQL is a language; MySQL is an RDBMS that accepts and executes SQL.

**Q3. Why are relationships important in an RDBMS?**
**Ideal answer:** Relationships connect related records across tables using keys, allowing related information to be retrieved without storing everything in one table.

**Q4. What is the role of a DBMS?**
**Ideal answer:** It manages operations such as storing, retrieving, updating, deleting, access control, consistency, backup, and recovery.

**Q5. Can non-relational databases use SQL?**
**Ideal answer:** Some non-relational systems may provide SQL-like languages or SQL interfaces, but SQL is primarily associated with relational databases.

### Chapter 3 — SQL Command Categories

**Q1. What is the difference between DDL and DML?**
**Ideal answer:** DDL changes database structure; DML changes the records stored inside that structure.

**Q2. What is DQL used for?**
**Ideal answer:** DQL retrieves data. SELECT is the main DQL command in the course notes.

**Q3. What do DCL commands do?**
**Ideal answer:** GRANT gives permissions and REVOKE removes previously granted permissions.

**Q4. What is TCL used for?**
**Ideal answer:** TCL manages transactions using commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

**Q5. Which category does SELECT belong to?**
**Ideal answer:** DQL in the classification used in these notes.

### Chapter 4 — Database, Schema, Table, Row and Column

**Q1. Database vs table?**
**Ideal answer:** A database is a container for related database objects; a table stores records for one entity or concept.

**Q2. Row vs column?**
**Ideal answer:** A row is one complete record; a column is one property or attribute shared by the records.

**Q3. What is a schema?**
**Ideal answer:** A schema is the logical blueprint describing tables, columns, data types, relationships, and rules. In MySQL, database and schema are generally used interchangeably.

**Q4. What is a value?**
**Ideal answer:** A value is the actual piece of data stored at the intersection of a row and a column.

**Q5. Can one database contain multiple tables?**
**Ideal answer:** Yes. A college database can contain Students, Courses, Attendance, Marks, and Placements tables.

### Chapter 5 — MySQL Server and Workbench

**Q1. Is MySQL Workbench the database server?**
**Ideal answer:** No. Workbench is a graphical client/interface; MySQL Server stores data and executes SQL.

**Q2. What is the default MySQL port used in the notes?**
**Ideal answer:** 3306.

**Q3. What does localhost mean in a local MySQL connection?**
**Ideal answer:** It refers to the same computer on which the MySQL Server is running.

**Q4. Why can Workbench open but queries still fail?**
**Ideal answer:** Workbench can be installed while the MySQL Server service is stopped or misconfigured; the client still needs a working server connection.

**Q5. How do you verify a successful installation?**
**Ideal answer:** Connect to the server and run SELECT VERSION() and SHOW DATABASES, then create a small test database/table and execute a SELECT.

### Chapter 6 — SQL Data Types

**Q1. DECIMAL vs DOUBLE for money?**
**Ideal answer:** Use DECIMAL for exact financial values. FLOAT and DOUBLE are approximate floating-point types and can introduce rounding differences.

**Q2. CHAR vs VARCHAR?**
**Ideal answer:** CHAR is fixed-length; VARCHAR stores variable-length text up to its declared maximum.

**Q3. DATETIME vs TIMESTAMP?**
**Ideal answer:** DATETIME is suitable for fixed date/time values without timezone conversion; TIMESTAMP is commonly used for event timestamps and has timezone conversion behavior.

**Q4. Why should dates not be stored as VARCHAR?**
**Ideal answer:** Proper date/time types support validation, chronological comparison, sorting, and date arithmetic.

**Q5. Why choose the smallest practical numeric type?**
**Ideal answer:** It reduces storage and can improve index and scan efficiency, especially across large tables.

### Chapter 7 — Modifying Database Structure

**Q1. MODIFY vs CHANGE in ALTER TABLE?**
**Ideal answer:** MODIFY changes a column's definition while keeping its name. CHANGE can rename the column and redefine its type.

**Q2. TRUNCATE vs DROP?**
**Ideal answer:** TRUNCATE removes all rows but keeps the table structure; DROP removes the table itself, including its structure and data.

**Q3. Can TRUNCATE use WHERE?**
**Ideal answer:** No. TRUNCATE removes all rows.

**Q4. What does ALTER TABLE do?**
**Ideal answer:** It changes an existing table's structure, such as adding, modifying, renaming, or removing columns.

**Q5. Does renaming a column automatically update application code?**
**Ideal answer:** No. Queries, views, procedures, or application code that reference the old name may need separate updates.

### Chapter 8 — Keys and Constraints

**Q1. Can a table have two primary keys?**
**Ideal answer:** No. A table has one primary key constraint, although that key may be composite and contain multiple columns.

**Q2. PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE?**
**Ideal answer:** PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies rows and cannot be NULL; UNIQUE enforces uniqueness and can allow NULL according to MySQL's rules.

**Q3. What does NOT NULL enforce?**
**Ideal answer:** It prevents a column from storing NULL values.

**Q4. What is a foreign key?**
**Ideal answer:** It is a column or set of columns that references a key in another table and enforces referential integrity.

**Q5. Why are constraints important?**
**Ideal answer:** They enforce data-quality rules at the database level instead of relying only on application code.

### Chapter 9 — DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

**Q1. What happens if UPDATE has no WHERE clause?**
**Ideal answer:** Every row is updated with the specified values.

**Q2. What happens if DELETE has no WHERE clause?**
**Ideal answer:** Every row is deleted, while the table itself remains.

**Q3. Can UPDATE modify multiple columns?**
**Ideal answer:** Yes; multiple column=value pairs can be listed in SET separated by commas.

**Q4. Can DML violate constraints?**
**Ideal answer:** Yes. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are checked against applicable constraints and referential-integrity rules.

**Q5. Why should SELECT be run before UPDATE or DELETE?**
**Ideal answer:** It lets you verify exactly which rows match the condition before changing or removing them.
